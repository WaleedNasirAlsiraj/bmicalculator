            <br>
            <p>In a time when our culture seems to be obsessed with weight, fitness, eating right, and exercising, the term BMI or Body Mass Index is mentioned often in fitness circles and physician’s offices. Over the last 40 years, many doctors have shifted their focus from weight to BMI when it comes to determining the health of their patients. However, many people do not understand what BMI is or how it is used to determine a person’s overall health. Understanding this term and how it relates to weight loss and health can help an individual achieve the healthiest weight for their body.</p>

        <div class="intro">
            <h1><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> What is BMI?</h1>
            <p>Your Body Mass Index is figured in a percentage once a calculation is made based on your height and weight. To figure BMI a person’s weight is divided by the square of their height. Don't worry, there are many free websites online that will perform the calculation for you in seconds. It's important to note that calculations for children and adults are different and different calculators are used for this purpose.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This percentage is then applied to a chart that determines if the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. BMI is a better determiner of healthy body weight than weight alone because it height takes into consideration. For example, if you weigh 180 pounds, a doctor can't label you as overweight or underweight without considering how tall you are. A person weighing 180 pounds and being 6’2” is a normal weight; however, a person weighing 180 pounds and standing 5’2” is considered obese. BMI takes into consideration both factors to determine a healthy weight for people of differing heights.</p>

            <h1><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> What do BMI numbers mean and how are they used?</h1>
            <p>Now that BMI is commonly used, it should be understood what the numbers mean. Generally a BMI of 18.5 to 25% indicates a normal, healthy weight. A BMI under 18.5% means a person is underweight, and a BMI from 26-30% means a person is overweight. A BMI over 30% means a person is obese, and a BMI under 18.5% means a person is too thin with a number below 17.5% indicating a person many be suffering from anorexia nervosa.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The numbers are used in many ways. First of all, BMI is used by doctors to asses to overall health of their patients. Determining if a person is overweight or underweight can help a doctor better treat health conditions, even preventing or reversing some conditions that have to do with weight. Some doctors prefer not to use BMI as a determining factor in assessing health. They prefer to assess the overall life style of patients, habits, and family history.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This index is used by personal trainers and fitness professionals to determine the weight lose or weight gain goals of their clients. It is a starting point in setting an overall fitness plan. Incremental goals such as adding to or subtracting from a person’s BMI number are easier to measure and obtain and indicate more results than just a number on a scale.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some insurance companies use these percentages when determining a person’s premium rates and coverage. The National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization have both adopted BMI numbers as a determining factor in the overall health and health risks of individuals. Many insurance companies have adopted this as well. Insurance companies may ask for a person’s BMI when they are applying for health insurance and/or life insurance. If BMI is too high, an individual may be denied insurance or charged a higher premium rate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>BMI is used by local, state, and federal government agencies to determine the risk factors of the people they govern. A recent survey showed that 59% of men and 49% of women in America have a BMI over 25 making them overweight. The survey also indicated that 4% of American women and 2% of American men are morbidly obese. The government than takes these numbers into consideration when allocating funding for programs, hospitals, and education needs in the community.</p>

            <h1><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> What are some limitations of BMI?</h1>
            <p>BMI has its limitations and some doctors and educators are lobbying for significant changes. The main limitation of BMI is that it only takes into consideration weight and height. Though it is a step above simply using a person’s weight to determine health, there are many factors left out of the BMI calculations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For example, a person’s bone density and size are not taken into consideration. Some people are referred to as big-boned. This is not just an alternate term to fat, as some people believe. There are actually different bone sizes and densities within people. This is determined by ethnicity, family history, and other factors. Bone density is not taken into consideration when determining a person’s Body Mass Index.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Muscle mass is also not taken into consideration. A body builder may have little to no fat on their body, but their BMI number may indicate that they are overweight because of the size and mass of their muscles. Just as with bones, muscle mass is different in different people. On the other hand, a person may be determined healthy by BMI but have no muscle mass to their body. Muscle to fat ratio is an important factor that is left out of these calculations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Harmful habits such as smoking, drinking, and drug use are other important factors outside the realm of body mass. A person may be classified as healthy due to BMI, but actually be very unhealthy and at high risk do to lifestyle choices. The same goes for family history. A person with a normal body weight as determined by BMI may be a risk for heart disease or cancer due to family history, exposure, or other factors.</p>

            <h1><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Conclusions of Using Body Mass Index</h1>
            <p>Though the application of BMI for individuals was not the purpose of those who invented and expanded on the calculations, it has become a popular and effective determining factor used by many people. However, it should not be the only determining factor and it should not be used as the only indicator in an overall fitness program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Knowing your Body Mass Index is an appropriate starting point for weight loss, as a way to maintain a healthy weight, as well as a way to increase weight in those who are underweight. When the limitations are taken into consideration and other factors of health are assessed, BMI can be a fair assessment of a person’s weight and health.</p>
